# OneLine
OneLine is a puzzle video game that uses graphs and asks the user to find the paths that connect all the vertices in it.

## Mechanics

You are given a set of levels with a different graph each.The goal is to recreate the connections or edges of the graph. Graphs can be directed, undirected and weighted. 

## Level creator

A level creator tool is implemented. This allows you to draw and save any graph with its multiple edges variations.

## About

This project was built using Processing 3.
The default levels graphs were taken from the mobile game "1LINE".
Levels are saved into Json files.
